# Arduino Uno 2 tones siren
A siren with 2 tones (as the french ones) for an Arduino Uno
You can use it with this audio amplifier I found on Aliexpress to make it louder https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/32663297600.html (there still may be better ones)

# Here are the frequencies of the french services
| Type      | Police        | Firefighters  |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| 1rst tone | 435Hz         | 435Hz         |
| 2nd tone  | 580Hz         | 488Hz         |
| Frequency | 60 cycles/min | 30 cycles/min |

# Siren V1
The 1rst version of the siren is very simple, there's only 1 siren type, and you only need an arduino and a buzzer/speaker. You can use an Arduino Uno, NANO, or any other.
Here is how to set it up:
