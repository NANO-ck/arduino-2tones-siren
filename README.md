# Arduino Una 2 tones siren
A siren with 2 tones (as the french ones) for an Arduino Uno
You can use it with this audio amplifier I found on Aliexpress to make it louder https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/32663297600.html (there still may be better ones)

| Type      | Police        | Firefighters  |

| 1rst tone | 435Hz         | 435Hz         |
| 2nd tone  | 580Hz         | 488Hz         |
| Frequency | 60 cycles/min | 30 cycles/min |
